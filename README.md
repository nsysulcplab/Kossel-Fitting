First, please use "Kossel_ImgCutting.m" to crop the Kossel diagram image captured from the experiment.

Use Kossel_L1NormERRScan.m to find the lattice constants of the crystal structure (e.g., cubic, orthorhombic, and tetragonal).

For fitting higher degree of freedom crystal structures (e.g., monoclinic and triclinic), you can use the files Kossel_Triclinic.m and Kossel_Triclinic_GA.m for genetic algorithms.
